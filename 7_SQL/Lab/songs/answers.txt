If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
By using their average energy, valence, and danceability, plus them and then calculate the average number again.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Add tempo, speechiness and loudness as parameters.
